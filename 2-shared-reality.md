# Shared reality

Shared reality is defined as any overlap of any aspect of two or more individuals’ Personal realities. A key difference between Shared reality and Personal reality is the manner in which Shared reality is structured. Shared reality has neither root nor center. It is composed of conscious and unconscious external expressions and individual experiences. In all cases, any individual’s Personal reality makes up exactly half of any Shared reality that individual experiences. The other half of any Shared reality is made up by the collective and representative expressions and experiences of other members of the Shared reality, *as experienced in an individual’s Personal reality*.        
          
This is a critical point. Empirically verifiable phenomena are so called because any arbitrary individual can have an experience that is empirically identical to another individual’s experience. For example, think of any simple empirical measurement, such as finding the length of a dowel rod. In many individuals’ Personal realities, there is a narrative which describes the relationship of units of measurement to physical objects. Any individual can use that narrative to express the results of their measurement. Given a common understanding of the narrative and a fixed physical object, the measurement is identical regardless of which individual actually acts to take the measurement. This is the triangulation that takes place: An individual finds the result of a measurement (experiences an event) in their Personal reality and expresses that measurement into Shared reality. The expressions of other individuals in Shared reality about the same event, *as experienced by the individual*, corroborate the measurement experienced in their Personal reality. The consistency and precision with which this corroboration occurs is the measure by which some thing or event can be said to be empirically verifiable. When an event is *literally the same* regardless of who experiences the event or when they do, the event is empirically verifiable.  

Yet clearly Reality does not consist solely of that which is empirically verifiable. Many Shared realities are formed when aspects of individuals’ Personal realities that are not empirically verifiable overlap. For example, think of any simple human relationship, like that between a barista and a customer. In many individuals Personal realities, there is a narrative that describes the relationship between baristas and customers. Any individual can use that narrative to express the expectations and experiences they have in and for that relationship. But the experiences and expectations of any individual in that relationship do not necessarily have to be the same or even similar to those of any other individual. Those two individuals can have a successful, mutually beneficial (or disastrous and destructive) experience in the Shared reality formed by their simple relationship regardless of whether their individual understanding of the relationship has anything in common with the other individual’s understanding. They can walk away from the interaction with very similar, or wildly divergent experiences. It is their interaction itself that creates Shared reality, regardless of whether any part of the interaction was empirically verifiable.

Shared reality is formed by the overlap and interaction of individuals’ Personal realities. These interactions can be simple, subtle, and empirically verifiable. For example, all humans share the reality of breathing the same atmosphere (at least most of the time, at least for now). 

Shared reality can also be formed from interactions that are complex, obvious, and are not empirically verifiable. For example, many individuals share a reality of religion, or nationality, or social standing. Shared reality is formed from conscious interactions and unconscious interactions. Regardless of the scale or function of the interaction, or the awareness of any individuals in that interaction of the interaction, Shared reality emerges when Personal realities overlap.
