# The phase transition

The world is currently going through a phase transition. Humans are currently living through a widespread and foundational transition in how we live, organize, sustain, and understand ourselves and the world around us. Technological advances in computing, biomedical science, robotics, materials science, data science, and energy (among other fields) have exponentially increased our capacities and options to manipulate and control the world within a few decades. Alongside this massive technological transition, the biosphere is undergoing changes at a similar scale. 

This exponential growth in power and rapidly changing environment has and will continue to outpace the models, methods, and mechanisms that legacy cultures and institutions use to create consensus and incite constructive action. Nevertheless, these changes will continue. 

The powers we have gained and will gain make possible a future that has the potential to make all of the greatest achievements in all of our greatest myths seem like trivialities compared to the world we could experience. At the same time, both the powers we have obtained and the side effects of their use threatens to bring all we have to ruin. 

As humans, we have a unique ability to adapt to changes in our environment within a single generation. Unlike other animals that are slave to instinct and genetics, we have some limited ability to self-select for adaptive traits and opt out of deleterious traits. What is adaptive and what is deleterious can be dependent on an individual and their particular environment, but accurately perceiving ones environment is a necessary precondition to adopting adaptive traits. This section briefly describes a few of the large scale changes that we as a species must adapt to. 

The transitions described here are inevitable, one way or another. Whether we acknowledge them or whether our current global civilization survives the transition without catastrophic general systems collapse is not. The goal of this project is to provide some models that can be useful on an individual level, with the hope that individuals with more adaptive models will be able to collectively navigate these and other related transitions as smoothly as possible. 

A few of the transitions that are defining this phase shift include:
* Climate change, marked by the transition from the Holocene to the Anthropocene
* Energy production and consumption from fossil fuels to renewable electricity
* Reassessment of the monetary representations of cost and value
* Rebalancing of labor and capital as automation, artificial intelligence, and robotics decouple labor and production
* Rebalancing governance and sovereignty among individuals, nation-states, and nonhuman legal persons

## Climate

The biosphere is changing as a result of large-scale human activity. Adapting to these changes is the largest challenge our species has ever faced. Most other large mammalian species in Earth's history have gone extinct in the face of drastic environmental changes. The odds are against us. For all of the discussion about how to limit or mitigate these changes to our environment, the reality remains that by the end of the century, the biosphere will have significantly changed as compared to the glacial environment in which we colonized the planet. We may deny the tide, but it will come in regardless.   

Humans can and will occupy all habitable niches in this changing environment as long as we can. However, it is important to realize that global resources like the atmosphere, oceans, forests, and farmland are are under no obligation to remain habitable for humans. In the long term, the only economic and societal models which enable the long term survival of the human species are those in which human prosperity and progress enhance the habitability of Earth for humans. All economic and societal models that are based on extraction, exploitation, and the degradation of the biosphere will someday end in ruin.

## Energy

Presently, global fossil energy consumption (coal, oil, and gas) is about 443 billion, 333 million, 333 thousand, 333 gigajoules per year, or about 130,000 terawatt hours. Given that there is roughly 6 gigajoules of energy in a standardized barrel of oil, conservatively, the world as we know it is currently riding on a the roaring fires of roughly 10 barrels of oil per person per year. Every year since roughly the 1930s, the global average amount of fossil energy it takes to extract more fossil energy increases. The more fuel we use to propel our civilization, the more fuel we need to stay in the same place.

This energy powers everything, from the movement of goods and people, to the production of food and goods, to the value and movement of currency. There is no known way of sustaining the networks we have created around this flow of energy without maintaining the flow of energy. At our current trajectory, this flow of energy will raise the global average temperature by about 4 degrees Celsius. 

Our system is burning up. The fires, literal and metaphorical, are spreading. If we cannot find a way to sustain our networks without this energy, they will burn away, and so may we. 

Doing this requires fundamentally shifting the very foundation of the movement of goods and people, the production of food and goods, and the value and movement of currency. This extract/ship/burn model of energy must be replaced by a generate/transmit/charge model of energy. We must learn to sustain ourselves on living energy instead of fossil energy, lest we become fossils ourselves.

This transition is ongoing, and will continue until our systemic foundations shift to a new stability. Our quest is to harness the energy of the stars, including our own star. Fusion, solar, and wind will replace oil, coal, and gas this century as the engines of human organization. 



 

## Cost, value, labor, and capital

Right now we're operating in an economic system that has abstracted the relationship between value and money to an insane degree. The basic purpose of money is to create a medium for value exchange, but the way our economic and financial system is set up, that relationship has been essentially destroyed.

In an ideal world, money is used as a way to quantize value and cost. So for example, assume I have something that is valuable, like a pile of wood, and I want to exchange some of that wood for some sheep. Rather than figuring out exactly how much wood I need to trade for the sheep I want, I convert the wood into money, and then use the money to buy the sheep. 

But this example is only applicable for things that 1: have value, and 2: can be monetized. However, currently there are many things that have value but are not monetized, like childcare. Caring for one's own child is valuable, both on an individual level and on a societal level, but it is not monetized. This effectively makes effective childcare worthless, because it is literally unaccounted for in our primary means of value exchange.

Of course, because the price of caring for one's own child is 0, any attempt to exchange the value of child care (or senior care) between people will assume that anyone doing that work isn't doing much of value at all.

There are also things that are monetized, but have no value. Anyone holding another person's debt or engaging in high frequency stock trading can end up with quite a lot of money without creating or contributing anything of value.

There is a similar problem in our current system between cost and monetization. Energy generation has a cost, and some of those costs are monetized: the inputs, installation, maintenance, etc required are monetized. But other costs, like the waste products of that energy production, are not monetized. Dumping coal slurry into a river is costly but because that cost is not monetized, our economic system acts like it doesn't exist.

## Governance
   

Whatever the specific path forward from here might be, we must update the models, mechanisms, and methods we use to navigate the world. One very basic truth that I would like to propose is this:  

Everyone experiences Reality as at least a duality. There is Personal reality, and there is Shared reality.  

# Purpose

A Handbook for Humans is an open source project that describes some commonalities among arbitrary individuals' subjective experiences of Reality. My hope is that various individuals can use these models to better understand themselves and other people, and reduce both intrapersonal and interpersonal conflict. My intention is to avoid digging into the *contents* of any individual’s Personal reality, or any group’s Shared reality, and instead describe aspects of Reality that seem useful to those ends. 

From an empirical standpoint, most of this handbook falls into the category of pseudoscientific bullshit. That does not make it any less true or useful. Most human interactions and experiences are in no way empirical. Developing facilities by which we can interact with other humans and our selves in omni-positive ways is an existential need for our species. The siloed expertises and mutually incompatible belief systems of prior centuries are still useful, but are fundamentally inadequate at providing average people the models, motives, and means to effectively navigate the 21st century. 

## Disclaimer

We must remember, at all times, that all language is metaphorical. The sounds and symbols we use to communicate are not literally the same as that which we are communicating about. For example, what you, who you call *I*, think of when you see the symbol *I* is not *literally the same* as what I think of when I see the symbol I. 

Some of the concepts I approach here are difficult to discuss directly. Not because the concepts themselves are complicated or unfamiliar, but because many of the words I use have slight, but significant differences in meaning depending on who reads or with them. In all likelihood, the words I will use to describe certain concepts or mechanics will not mean *literally the same thing* to you as they do to me. But starting the conversation is important. These patterns and concepts are very common, if not universal. If any part of this project seems familiar or useful, please hear me out.
