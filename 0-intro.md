# Introduction

## The phase transition

The world is currently going through a phase transition. Multiple factors are changing the way humans experience the world at a scale and depth that has no precedent in known history. Technological advances in computing, biomedical science, robotics, materials science, data science, and energy (among other fields) have exponentially increased our capacities and options to manipulate and control the world within a few decades. Alongside this massive technological transition, the biosphere is undergoing changes at a similar scale. 

This exponential growth in power and rapidly changing environment has and will continue to outpace the models, methods, and mechanisms that legacy cultures and institutions use to create consensus and incite constructive action. Nevertheless, these changes will continue. 

The powers we have gained and will gain make possible a future that has the potential to make all of the greatest achievements in all of our greatest myths seem like trivialities compared to the world we could experience. At the same time, both the powers we have obtained and the side effects of their use threatens to bring all we have to ruin. 

Whatever the specific path forward from here might be, we must update the models, mechanisms, and methods we use to navigate the world. One very basic truth that I would like to propose is this:  

Everyone experiences Reality as at least a duality. There is Personal reality, and there is Shared reality.  
   
## Purpose

A Handbook for Humans is an open source project that describes some commonalities among arbitrary individuals' subjective experiences of Reality. My hope is that various individuals can use these models to better understand themselves and other people, and reduce both intrapersonal and interpersonal conflict. My intention is to avoid digging into the *contents* of any individual’s Personal reality, or any group’s Shared reality, and instead describe aspects of Reality that seem useful to those ends. 

## Disclaimer

We must remember, at all times, that all language is metaphorical. The sounds and symbols we use to communicate are not literally the same as that which we are communicating about. For example, what you, who you call *I*, think of when you see the symbol *I* is not *literally the same* as what I think of when I see the symbol I. 

Some of the concepts I approach here are difficult to discuss directly. Not because the concepts themselves are complicated or unfamiliar, but because many of the words I use have slight, but significant differences in meaning depending on who reads or with them. In all likelihood, the words I will use to describe certain concepts or mechanics will not mean *literally the same thing* to you as they do to me. But starting the conversation is important. These patterns and concepts are very common, if not universal. If any part of this project seems familiar or useful, please hear me out.
