# The phase transition

The world is currently going through a phase transition. Humans are currently living through a widespread and foundational transition in how we live, organize, sustain, and understand ourselves and the world around us. Technological advances in computing, biomedical science, robotics, materials science, data science, and energy (among other fields) have exponentially increased our capacities and options to manipulate and control the world within a few decades. Alongside this massive technological transition, the biosphere is undergoing changes at a similar scale. 

This exponential growth in power and rapidly changing environment has and will continue to outpace the models, methods, and mechanisms that legacy cultures and institutions use to create consensus and incite constructive action. Nevertheless, these changes will continue. 

The powers we have gained and will gain make possible a future that has the potential to make all of the greatest achievements in all of our greatest myths seem like trivialities compared to the world we could experience. At the same time, both the powers we have obtained and the side effects of their use threatens to bring all we have to ruin. 

As humans, we have a unique ability to adapt to changes in our environment within a single generation. Unlike other animals that are slave to instinct and genetics, we have some limited ability to self-select for adaptive traits and opt out of deleterious traits. What is adaptive and what is deleterious can be dependent on an individual and their particular environment, but accurately perceiving ones environment is a necessary precondition to adopting adaptive traits. This section briefly describes a few of the large scale changes that we as a species must adapt to. 

The transitions described here are inevitable, one way or another. Whether we acknowledge them or whether our current global civilization survives the transition without catastrophic general systems collapse is not. The goal of this project is to provide some models that can be useful on an individual level, with the hope that individuals with more adaptive models will be able to collectively navigate these and other related transitions as smoothly as possible. 

A few of the transitions that are defining this phase shift include:
* Climate change, marked by the transition from the Holocene to the Anthropocene
* Energy production and consumption from fossil fuels to renewable electricity
* Reassessment of the monetary representations of cost and value
* Rebalancing of labor and capital as automation, artificial intelligence, and robotics decouple labor and production
* Rebalancing governance and sovereignty among individuals, nation-states, and nonhuman legal persons

## Energy

## Money

## Work

## Governance
   

Whatever the specific path forward from here might be, we must update the models, mechanisms, and methods we use to navigate the world. One very basic truth that I would like to propose is this:  

Everyone experiences Reality as at least a duality. There is Personal reality, and there is Shared reality.  

# Purpose

A Handbook for Humans is an open source project that describes some commonalities among arbitrary individuals' subjective experiences of Reality. My hope is that various individuals can use these models to better understand themselves and other people, and reduce both intrapersonal and interpersonal conflict. My intention is to avoid digging into the *contents* of any individual’s Personal reality, or any group’s Shared reality, and instead describe aspects of Reality that seem useful to those ends. 

From an empirical standpoint, most of this handbook falls into the category of pseudoscientific bullshit. That does not make it any less true or useful. Most human interactions and experiences are in no way empirical. Developing facilities by which we can interact with other humans and our selves in omni-positive ways is an existential need for our species. The siloed expertises and mutually incompatible belief systems of prior centuries are still useful, but are fundamentally inadequate at providing average people the models, motives, and means to effectively navigate the 21st century. 

## Disclaimer

We must remember, at all times, that all language is metaphorical. The sounds and symbols we use to communicate are not literally the same as that which we are communicating about. For example, what you, who you call *I*, think of when you see the symbol *I* is not *literally the same* as what I think of when I see the symbol I. 

Some of the concepts I approach here are difficult to discuss directly. Not because the concepts themselves are complicated or unfamiliar, but because many of the words I use have slight, but significant differences in meaning depending on who reads or with them. In all likelihood, the words I will use to describe certain concepts or mechanics will not mean *literally the same thing* to you as they do to me. But starting the conversation is important. These patterns and concepts are very common, if not universal. If any part of this project seems familiar or useful, please hear me out.
