# human-handbook

This is an attempt to describe something that has seemed very obvious to me my whole life. The models I try to describe have been useful to me, and when I have tried to share them with other people in person, feedback has been mostly positive. At least, the only person who has doubted my sanity so far has been me. 

Obviously this is incomplete. Any and all feedback is welcome.
