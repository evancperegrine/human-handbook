# Mechanics of Shared reality

A key point about Shared reality is that it is always based on individuals' overlapping Personal realities. There are a great many Shared realities that any individual may be part of at any given time. For example, speaking a language is sharing reality with all others who speak that language, whether that language is English, Mandarin, or Python. All of those individuals may be part of other, more encompassing shared realities, such as living within the same biosphere, or more limited shared realities, such as when two English speakers agree on some political policy or what is the best kind of beer (American Pale Ales, for the record). 

In many cases, Shared reality is empirically verifiable. The physical and social sciences contain the best known methods and models to describe empirically verifiable shared reality. The sciences are also quite effective at describing causality, making predictions, and providing applicable explanations for physical and social phenomena. The scientific method is a staggeringly powerful tool, and on balance has improved the human condition more effectively than any other construct in history. 

However, Shared reality consists of more than that which is empirically verifiable. While the scientific method is still a useful tool to make observations and categorizations about various nonempirical aspects Shared reality (for example, religion, or the concept of family), the scientific method itself must be practiced with great discipline and its conclusions must be vigorously tested, for uncontrolled human reality is fraught with various nonempirical phenomena that can affect the results of experiments. Variables as subtle as the time of day/week when a survey is taken can affect social experiments, and variations in medical practitioners' body language can affect medical experiments. 

All of which is to say that none of the models I offer here are intended to be comprehensive, or superior to established science. My intention is instead to describe patterns that may be useful when understanding this model of human experience as a duality. 


## Direct interactions

Direct interactions in Shared reality are interactions in which two or more individuals influence each others' Personal reality without an intermediary party or technology.
