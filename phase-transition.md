# The phase shift

Humans are currently living through a widespread and foundational transition in how we live, organize, sustain, and understand ourselves and the world around us. Technological changes are occuring at a rate and scope that is unprecedented in recorded history. At the same time, the scale of the gloabl human population and the manner in which it interacts with itself and its habitat has rendered old models and methods inadequate at explaining or predicting the emerging global environment. 

As humans, we have a unique ability to adapt to changes in our environment within a single generation. Unlike other animals that are slave to instinct and genetics, we have some limited ability to self-select for adaptive traits and opt out of deleterous traits. What is adaptive and what is deleterous can be dependent on an individual and their particular environment, but accurately perceiving ones environment is a necessary precondition to adopting adaptive traits. This section briefly describes a few of the large scale changes that we as a species must adapt to. 

The transitions described here are inevitable, one way or another. Whether we acknowledge them or whether our current global civilzation survives the transition without catastrophic general systems collapse is not. The goal of this project is to provide some models that can be useful on an individual level, with the hope that individuals with more adaptive models will be able to collectively navigate these and other related transitions as smoothly as possible. 

A few of the transitions that are defining this phase shift include:
* Climate change, marked by the transition from the Holocene to the Anthropocene
* Energy production and consumption from fossil fuels to renewable electricity
* Reassessment of the monetary representations of cost and value
* Rebalancing of labor and capital as automation, artificial intelligene, and robotics decouple labor and production
* Rebalancing governance and sovereingnty among individuals, nationstates, and nonhuman legal persons
