Notes
*****

*  Our economic systems biggest winners are those who monitize the infrastructure of peoples' personal and shared realities. 
* 	The technologies and abilities we have to influence reality have far outpaced the models and methods we have to interact with and understand 	reality.
*	Basic human experience != human nature. Human nature is a myth used to justify and normalize one's own personal reality, experiences, narratives, etc. to then understand the world. But the whole spectrum of human experience is human nature. Individuals just emphasize different parts of it in their own personal reality.
*	A determining adaptive factor in how different realities express influence in the world is how well the premises etc of that reality facilitate collaboration among greater numbers of people. Broad, beneficial collaboration and reality sharing is an adaptive benefit. Worldviews, or realities that an individual chooses to uphold, grow stronger as more people uphold them. With all the normal caveats about what any individual considers "benefit" and "collaboration" to mean.   
*	There is a lot of attention on shared reality in public discourse. There is less attention on personal reality. But large scale patterns in shared reality/society are simply macro representations of the patterns of personal reality of a great many people, and how individuals express their personal reality into shared reality. There is little talk about the loop between personal reality and shared reality, and how aspects or trends in one can (broadly) predictably effect change in the other.
